Quick program to import local users and groups (and associated shadow files) 
from one machine to append to another, such as when doing a hardware migration.

Copy /etc/passwd, group, shadow and gshadow to a working directory then run
migrate_users.py and it will output new versions with '_to_append.txt' appended.

These should be safe to add to the ends of the new systems' files.

Edit migrate_users.py to add any exclusions and to specify the minimum exported 
UID value (defaults to 1000 although old systems may wish to specify 500).
